## Introduction
Slung is a simple open source arcade game that works on virtually all phones and tablets. I developed and published Slung under the developer name Arsom Games to learn about the experience of publishing a game on multiple mobile platforms. 

## Game Description
Slung is a fast-paced casual slingshot game! Pop the bubbles before they touch the ground!

Features:
- Intuitive gameplay for anyone
- Difficult to master
- Satisfying synth sound effects
- Pastel rainbows

## Dependencies
This project requires Unity 2022.3.7f1, and might not work with later versions.

This repo relies on Git LFS (which is installed automatically with GitHub Desktop).

## Usage
After cloning the repo, simply open "Slung.sln", or add it to Unity Hub.

"Circle Saver" was the placeholder name for Slung, and you might see this name in lieu of "Slung"
