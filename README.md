## Introduction
Slung is a very simple open source arcade game that works on virtually all phones and tablets. I developed and published Slung under the developer name Arsom Games to learn about the experience of publishing a game on multiple mobile platforms. 

## Dependencies
This project requires Unity 2022.3.7f1, and might not work with later versions.

This repo relies on Git LFS (which is installed automatically with GitHub Desktop).

## Usage
After cloning the repo, simply open "Slung.sln", or add it to Unity Hub.

## Game Description
Slung is a fast-paced casual slingshot game! Pop the bubbles before they touch the ground!

Features:
- Intuitive gameplay for anyone
